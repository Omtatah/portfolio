                    <p>A strong believer of personal confort and relaxation, people tend to mistake me for a lazy person
                        however, it is worthwhili to note that this simply is not true. In retrospect, although I like
                        to
                        take it easy, I am easily the most driven person around when it comes to pursuing my
                        passions(like
                        reading books and taking photos).</p>
                    <p>In am an open-minded individual who strongly supports secularism as a way of life. I tend to be
                        very
                        vocal about my ideologies especially when one tries to criticize me for them. I should however
                        point
                        out that although I am quick to defend my stand, I see no shame in admitting where I am wrong.
                        If
                        anything, one might argue that I indeed enjoy a challenging debate which ends with my ideologies
                        being debunked. This is simply because loosing an arguement is an oppourtunity to grow and view
                        the
                        world through a different pair of eyes.</p>
                    <p>I decided to venture into the coding world simply because I was curious about computers and how
                        they
                        work. At first, it was just a curious rush but the more I learnt about how simple codes
                        communicate
                        complex instructions to these bomplex machines via tags, the more beautiful and appealing the
                        world
                        became to me. Slowly but surely the curiousity morphed into a passion when I looked around and
                        discovered how technology can be used to solve global problems. It was at this point that I
                        simply
                        had to enroll for coding classes here at Moringa School.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>As such, my hobbies tend to revolve around the idea of exploration and discovery. These include:

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <div class='content1'>
                    <p>Over the course of about a week now, I've been introduced to coding and programming. By employing
                        the various skills I've obtained tus far, such as HTML and CSS, I have managed to carry out the
                        following projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>hello-world-in-five-languages<a
                                href="https://github.com/Omtatah/hello-5-languages.git">click
                                here to visit</a></li>
                        <p>This was a project that was made possible because of the guidance of Newton(the TM) who took
                            his time to take me through the various instructions HTML uses to carry out its processes.
                            The final result was a webpage where I managed to convey the message "Hello, world" in five
                            different languages save English,these languages are: Swahili, Kibaganda, Kikalenjin,
                            Kiluhya and Kikuyu.</p>
                        <li>HI<a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/HI.git">click here to visit</a></li>
                        <p>HI is a self initiated project i carried out to test various HTML instructions and Git
                            functions...although unimpressive to the experienced eye, it played a very significant role
                            in allowing me to comprehend the various functions HTML incorporates in its operations.</p>
                        <li>self1<a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/self1.git">click here to visit</a></li>
                        <p>Though the page is void of text, its purpose was to allow me to get to understand how to
                            marry images into my projects thus it was a booming success.</p>
                        <li>webpage1<a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/webpage1.git">click here to visit</a></li>
                        <p>webpage1 was an independent project I carried out after realizing how easy and to some extent
                            fun coding was...it only uses HTML and has a few lines of code but hopefully I'll get to
                            expand it during my free time.</p>
                        <li>cookie-recepie-1<a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/cookie-recipe-1.git">click here to
                                visit</a></li>
                        <p>Although the initial document was forked from iantheninja's github page, it did contain
                            tonnes of spacing and indenting errors that I fixed thus the final product has my work
                            incorporated in it too.</p>
